## CLI usage


The simplest usage is just to run `thought` from your project root directory.
In the default configuration, this will generate a `README.md` from the information in the `package.json`.

Calling `thought --help` will print a command-line reference:

{{{exec 'bin/thought.js --help' ''}}}
