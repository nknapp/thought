## Overview / Motivation

![Thought logo](docs/thought-logo.png)

The goal of Thought is making the documentation just as easy as thinking about it.

Are you sometimes annoyed about documentation that does not represent the current state of the project? 
Like example-snippets that don't work or have a different output when you actually run them?

Most of the time, the problem is, that the documentation lives too far away from the code. 
The API-reference is up-to-date most of the time, because it is actually maintained next 
to the code. But what about the rest?

With Thought, you can assemble documentation from a variety of places. You can include API-docs into
your README, you can include example and actually *run* them to include the output. You can include
the command line reference by calling the main program with a `--help` parameter.

When your examples throw errors, you will notice that. When you make changes to your code, 
the example output in your documentation will change as well!

Generating a simple `README.md` just requires executing `thought` in your project directories.
Thought will run your `package.json` through a Handlebars template with a list of registered partials in order to 
do that.

Since that is mostly not exactly what you want, it is possible to override each of the partials with your own 
and to create more templates each of which will result in one markdown-file in your repo.

Thought offers a small list of simple helpers to

* parse jsdoc-comments (not only in javascript-files but in many languages) and include them at any location in 
  your documenation files. 
* include any file
* include javascript example files (replacing `require` of the main module by the module name)
* run example files or any program and include the output
 
I have taken a lot of inspiration form [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) by Jon Schlinkert, but I wanted 
something simpler. There are other simple README-generators out there that you can't adapt, so the idea of 
using `package.json` to generate a README.md is not new.
