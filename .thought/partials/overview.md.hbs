Every npm-package should have a README-file that contains a short **description** of what it is and what it does, an 
explanation of how to **install** it, one or more usage **examples** and an API-reference 
for all functions, parameters and options.

Thought helps you create such a README without a lot of hassle.

**Easy startup**: Thought uses {{npm 'handlebars'}} with a default set of templates, partials and helpers to create a
README.md- and a CONTRIBUTING.md-file. The input of the template is mainly the `package.json`-file of your project.
Just run `thought run -a` in your project folder.

**Examples that actually work**: The file `examples/example.js` is included into the README by default. You can use `require('../')` to 
reference your package and thus build examples that are executable and testable. When you run `thought run -a`, the
`../` will be replaced by the name of your package. The example *will* be run and the output will be included as well.

**Fully customizable**: You can change every template, partials and helper if you need to. And since you are writing 
Handlebars-templates, you can use [helpers](docs/helpers.md) like `\{{npm 'lodash`\}}
to create a link to a package's npm-page and `\{{dirTree '.thought' 'snippets/**'}}` to generate directory-trees.

**Plugins**: You can write plugins that bundle your customizations. You can write a `thought-plugin-my-name-base`
that contains all the customizations that you need in your module. Or you can bundle certain functionalities, like
the {{npm 'thought-plugin-jsdoc'}} and share them on npm.
