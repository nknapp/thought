### Coding style

[![standard][standard-image]][standard-url]

This repository uses [`standard`][standard-url] to maintain code style and consistency,
and to avoid style arguments. You can run `npm run format` to apply the coding-style, but
you may need to fix some things manually. Make sure to use the latest version of `standard`.
